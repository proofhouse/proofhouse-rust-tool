//! Workspace task runner for the Proofhouse Rust tool reference repository.
//!
//! One task lives here. `coverage` reads lcov tracefiles, adds up the line and
//! branch records they carry, prints what each source file reached, and fails
//! unless the tests reached every instrumented line and every instrumented
//! branch.
//!
//! The coverage tool holds a single run to its own region threshold, and it has
//! no answer for the set of them. Each matrix slot writes a tracefile of its
//! own, and only the merged file says what those runs reached together. lcov is
//! line-oriented, so reading one takes no dependency beyond splitting text.
